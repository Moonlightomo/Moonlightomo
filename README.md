-hello my fellow human beings, funny seeing you here.
-a quick introduction to myself,

-Trying to figure out some way to code in lua without my brain literally exploding even though its used to make like a bunch of roblox games everyday.
-it doesnt really matter what pronouns you call me by cause i really do not care.
-im currently intrested in a developing a game with the same mechanics as omori.

-Fun fact: 2/15/25 processing is kinda annoying to work with
-(currently sick as a type this)

also slight rant but how did computers go from these big ol machines the size of garages to something that is literally as small as the very things that pass through your body every
single day, and the old ones were not even as good as the ones that can fit in our veins, only being able to hold a few megabytes, like imagine showing a nasa scientist from 1970
an iphone, they would be mesmerized.
